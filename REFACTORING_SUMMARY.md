# GoCodeWebsite Component Refactoring

## Overview

The large `GoCodeWebsite.tsx` file has been successfully separated into smaller, more manageable components for better maintainability and organization.

## New File Structure

### Types

- **`types/course.ts`** - Contains the `Course` interface definition

### UI Components

- **`components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx`** - Reusable loading spinner component
- **`components/ui/ErrorMessage.tsx`** - Reusable error message component with retry functionality

### Layout Components

- **`components/layout/Navbar.tsx`** - Complete navigation component including:
  - Desktop sidebar navigation
  - Mobile header and menu
  - User profile display
  - Authentication buttons

### Page Components

- **`components/pages/HomePage.tsx`** - Home page with hero section, features, and pricing
- **`components/pages/CoursesPage.tsx`** - Course listing and enrollment page
- **`components/pages/PracticePage.tsx`** - Practice problems page with course selection
- **`components/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`** - User dashboard with progress tracking

### Main Component

- **`components/GoCodeWebsite.tsx`** - Main application component that:
  - Manages global state (courses, loading, error, current page)
  - Handles API calls (fetchCourses, enrollInCourse)
  - Renders the appropriate page component based on current route
  - Provides a clean interface between all components

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability** - Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Better Code Organization** - Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Enhanced Reusability** - UI components can be reused across the application
4. **Easier Testing** - Individual components can be tested in isolation
5. **Better Collaboration** - Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously
6. **Reduced Bundle Size** - Components can be lazy-loaded if needed in the future

## Component Dependencies

```
GoCodeWebsite.tsx
├── types/course.ts
├── ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx
├── layout/Navbar.tsx
└── pages/
    ├── HomePage.tsx
    ├── CoursesPage.tsx
    ├── PracticePage.tsx
    └── DashboardPage.tsx
```

## Props Flow

The main `GoCodeWebsite` component manages state and passes the necessary props to each page component:

- **HomePage**: courses, loading, error, changePage, fetchCourses
- **CoursesPage**: courses, loading, error, session, fetchCourses, enrollInCourse, setCurrentPage
- **PracticePage**: courses, loading, error, session, fetchCourses, enrollInCourse, setCurrentPage
- **DashboardPage**: courses, session
- **Navbar**: session, currentPage, changePage, mobileMenuOpen, setMobileMenuOpen

All TypeScript errors have been resolved and the application maintains the same functionality as before.
